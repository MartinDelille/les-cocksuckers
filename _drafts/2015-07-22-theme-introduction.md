This post is a showcase of what Holo Alfa looks like, and a reference guide for how you can use it to make your blog shine.

<!--more-->

You can write posts using the familiar [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax, plus some extra's from [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). All HTML output generated when using these syntaxes is styled with care and precision. Generous whitespace is used to give your content some breathing room.

The image in the background can be set as `cover-image` in the [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) of a post or page. The "fade to white" will be created automatically. Cover images are stored in `/img/covers/`.

## Look, a H2 heading! ##

Add hierarchy to your content by using headings. It's recommended that you only use headings of `H2` and `H3`. This is because `H1` headings are used by the post title.

### H3 Heading ###

Are smaller than `H2` headings.

### H4 Heading ###

Too many heading sizes will make the content hierarchy less clear, so you are limited to three sizes: `H2`, `H3` and `H1`. `H1` being occupied by the title.

* The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
* Pa's wijze lynx bezag vroom het fikse aquaduct.
* Portez ce whisky au vieux juge blond qui fume.

Lists work as expected.

1. Blowzy night-frumps vex'd Jack Q. (A perfect [pangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram))
2. Alve bazige froulju wachtsje op dyn komst.
3. Flygande bäckasiner söka hwila på mjuka tuvor.

## Quotes, images and code blocks

Use Markdown's `>` to create a quote.

>It'll be nipper heaps trent from punchy oldies. Trent from punchy no dramas when flat out like a tucker-bag. He hasn't got a piker flamin frog in a sock.
><small>— [Bogan Ipsum](http://boganipsum.com/)</small>

Large enough images will be wider than the page.

![Forest]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/forest.jpg) <small>Source: [imgur.com](http://imgur.com/KTfsVZL)</small>

**Pro tip:** Use `<small></small>` tags on the same line as an image to create a source.

Next up is a code block with syntax highlighting, generated by Pygments.

{% highlight css %}
nav a:hover {
  color: rgba(0,0,0,.72);
}
nav a.current {
  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .72)
}
.subtitle {
  margin: 30px 0;
}

@media all and (min-width: 370px) {
  .website-title {
    font-size: 32px;
  }
  body {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  a {
    background-position: 0 18px;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's one without syntax highlighting, generated by GFM:

```
// this code block is generated by Github Flavoured Markdown
el.each(function() {
  if(s.remotePath != null && s.remoteTarget != null) {
    $.get(s.remotePath, function(data) {  
      setTime($('<div>').html(data).find(s.remoteTarget).text());
    });
  } else {
    setTime(el.text());
  }
});
```

## Video's ##

If you embed a video from YouTube, Vimeo or another popular video website [FitVids.js](http://fitvidsjs.com/) takes care of it being responsive.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRRolKTlF6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's time for a break.

In Markdown you can create a horizontal rule with `---`.

## Tables ##

Tables are a part of [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables), and are also styled in this theme.

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |

## That's it, for now... ##

You can get Holo Alfa at the [Github repository](https://github.com/steinvc/holo-alfa). Maybe add/suggest new features. Or report bugs.
